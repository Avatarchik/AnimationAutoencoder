Introduction

    Methods of motion capture (production level to DIY with Azure)
        History of motion capture for bodies, how it's done in the industry, level of fidelity (17 joints, 19, etc...)

        Started with rotoscoping in 1919 for the film: out of the inkwell in which animators traced over footage, frame by frame, to produce realistic action. Mixed realism with cartoon animation
        Early versions of motion capture: optical motion capture system and two tracking cameras, of which whose footage was traced back to render 2D motion of the actor

    Introduction to Neural networks and VAEs
        Deep learning with a neural network is a computational approach at modelling the biological way a brain solves problems using collections of neural units linked together (Rosenblatt 1958; Newell 1969). Deep nets are composed of layers of `neurons`, each of which is associated with different weights to assess the importance of one input parameter/feature compared to another. The advantage of a deep net is that it can be trained to identify very subtle features in large data sets. This learning capability is accomplished by algorithms that optimize the weights in such a way as to minimize the difference between the output of the deep net and the expected value from the training data. Deep nets have the ability to model complex non-linear relationships that may not be derivable analytically. The network does not rely on hand-designed metrics, instead it will learn the optimal features necessary to perform a task from our training data.

        * Introduction to VAEs, what they do, why is that good vs why not use a GAN
          interpolate within the latent space (Mars HiRISE VAE github)
          unsupervised learning of complicated distributions 
        
    How to combine the two 
        - denoising Azure kinect + procedural generation
        - Body Tracking SDK with Azure kinect vs PoseNET variants
        - Bodies come in different shapes and sizes, degeneracies with interpretting from images

Implementation and Training
    - Training Data (Animations from mixamo, Unity asset store, Azure Kinect)
    - Network Architecture (VAE, encoder vs decoder, 2D vs 3D latent space)
    - Genetic Algorithm to optimize architecture by minimizing MSE

Results
    - 2D VAE Map with animations in latent space
    - Take two poses and interpolate between in latent space
    - Take a defined animation, convert it to latent space path, slightly perturb path and see what happens
    - Errors in motion capture with Azure Kinect vs Interpolated positions with VAE and Time weighted

Conclusion and Future Work
    - training on other data (e.g. PoseNET with curated videos)
    - hint at a GAN or LSTM algorithm being used to descriminate the realistic nature
    - Zooniverse, community driven evaluation of animation sequences
    - Yoga Pose Sequence example, Tai Chi, etc.
